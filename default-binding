var instructor = 'Kara' // What happens when we change to let?


function ask(question) {
    console.log(this.instructor + ', ' + question)
}

ask('What is the default binding?')

/* 
See MDN docs for more detail on let vs var: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let
The main thing we should focus on is that if we change the declaration from var to let
`this.instructor` will end up printing undefined when the console.log prints
let (or const) does NOT create properties on the `window` or global object but var does so when
instructor is declared with var, it's on the window or global object. 
The default binding points to the global object.
