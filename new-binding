/* How 'new' works
1. Creates brand new empty object out of thin air
2. The newly created object (1) gets linked to another object
3. The newly created object (1) gets passed in as 'this' context to function call
4. If that function does not already return its own object, the new keyword assumes you meant to return the new object that was passed in -> implies 'return this'
